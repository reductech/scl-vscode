## SCL VS Code

This is the VS Code extension for SCL.

## To Build and Run

First, run `npm install` in the `.\Client` directory.

There are VS Code tasks defined to build both the client
and server. To use open the command palette (`F1`) then
go to `Tasks: Run Task`.

To start in debug mode, press `F5`.

## How to change settings

We hope to add an easier way to change this, but for now connector settings are in `\.vscode\extensions\reductech.reductech-scl-0.9.0\Server\appsettings.json`
